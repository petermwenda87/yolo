## IP2 Docker Project

This project sets up a microservices architecture using Docker Compose. It includes:
- A React frontend service
- A NodeJS backend service
- A MongoDB database service

I customized the Docker network with a specific subnet and bridge driver. I also edited the docker-compose.yaml to use my own DockerHub images. All services were built and ran successfully, demonstrating containerized development and deployment.
